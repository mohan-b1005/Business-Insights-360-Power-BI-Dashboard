## Company Background
AtliQ Hardware has grown rapidly in recent years and expanded its operations globally. The company sells computers and accessories via three channels:
- **Retailers**
- **Direct**
- **Distributors**

Recently, AtliQ faced an unexpected loss due to opening a store in America based on intuition rather than solid analytics. Competitors already had dedicated analytics teams to make data-driven decisions. AtliQ Hardware has now committed to building its analytics team to gain valuable insights and make informed business decisions in the future.

## Dataset Understanding
Understanding the dataset is critical for accurate analysis. The dataset contains:

- **Dimension Table**: Static data such as customer and product details.
- **Fact Table**: Transactional data for sales and forecasting.

### Key Tables
- **dim_customer**: Contains customer information across 27 markets and two platforms (Brick & Mortar, E-commerce).
- **dim_market**: Contains market details across 27 markets, seven sub-zones, and four regions.
- **dim_product**: Product data across divisions (Peripherals, PC, Networking, etc.).
- **fact_forecast_monthly**: Forecasting customer demand to improve satisfaction and reduce warehouse costs.
- **fact_sales_monthly**: Sales data, structured similarly to the forecast table, but with actual sales values.
- **freight_cost**: Travel and other costs per market.
- **gross_price**: Gross prices by product code.
- **manufacturing_cost**: Manufacturing costs by product and year.
- **pre_invoice_deductions**: Pre-invoice deductions percentage for customers.
- **post_invoice_deductions**: Post-invoice deductions and additional deductions.

## Importing Data into Power BI
The dataset is sourced from a MySQL database. The data is imported into Power BI by providing the database access credentials.

## Data Modeling
Data modeling forms the foundation of the Power BI report. Poor data modeling can negatively impact report performance. In this project, we followed the **Snowflake Data Modeling Method** to ensure efficiency and scalability.
